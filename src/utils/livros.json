The aim of this Special Issue of Systems is to contribute to a stronger theoretical basis for the business model concept. This includes a focus on the systemic character of business models and the systems approaches that this entails. Another important aspect is to allocate more attention to innovations of business models. The business models that emerged with e-commerce and e-business as such were in themselves innovations. However, innovations of business models have received too little attention. Most of the business models analyzed and discussed in the business model literature have been rather static instead of dynamic.

      "descricao": "This Special Issue on “Business Models and Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)” presents five research studies that examine transformative business models designed to support the United Nations SDG Agenda for 2030. The studies examine SDGs from the firm to national levels. Every organization has a business model that defines how the organization is designed to function. It is the engine that powers an organization, defining the value proposition of the venture, how it balances resources with the ecosystem where it operates, and how it generates cash flow and creates value. Changes to an organization’s business model are recognized as a fundamental approach to implementing innovations for sustainability. The capability to transform or transition to new business models is an important source of competitive advantage, providing leverage to improve the performance of an organization. A sustainable business model includes pro-active management, monetary and non-monetary value for a broad range of stakeholders, and takes a long-term perspective. A sustainable business model is where change, success, and hope for our planet’s future rests.",

      "descricao": "Consumers are an important source of innovation. They primarily innovate out of non-monetary motivations, such as use interest, learning and social rewards. Nonetheless, increasing numbers of such consumer and user innovators recently began diffusing their creations on online marketplaces, where they price and commercialize them. This empirical work reveals that, compared to firms, consumers’ different motivations to innovate affect their pricing decisions systematically in terms of cost, customer quality and competition considerations. Furthermore, it shows that customers’ price evaluations differ consistently when a product is marketed as created by consumers. Two empirical, sequential mixed methods studies were conducted for testing a series of hypotheses derived from fusing pricing research with consumer and user innovation theory. The empirical work was executed in the field of indie video games. Its core quantitative analyses were carried out with data scraped from the Steam computer game marketplace. Interviews and experiments with commercializing consumer innovators and their customers scaffold the findings from the market data analyses. The generated knowledge helps (a) consumer and user innovators to shape and validate their marketing strategies, (b) business administrators to respond to an influx of consumer innovators as competitors, and (c) economists in understanding the market impacts of commercial consumer innovation diffusion.",

      "descricao": "Business ethics continues to gain importance in the curricula of business studies courses. This book provides a comprehensive overview of both the essential concepts of business ethics related to the economy as a whole, and the more narrowly understood corporate ethics related to the individual company. In contrast to other works on the same topic, special emphasis is placed on a coherent theoretical foundation that puts tools of economic analysis, including behavioral economics, at the center. In particular, the importance of both empirical research and dilemma structures for business ethics receives special attention. The largest chapter of the book is devoted to corporate ethics and provides students and academics with guidance in the theoretical classification of the variety of concepts that often coexist in the debate. Abstract concepts are illustrated with the help of practice boxes.",

      "descricao": "The world’s people and their leaders face a complex and multifaceted set of ‘eco-social questions’. As the productivity of humanity increases, the negative external environmental effects of production and consumption patterns become increasingly problematic and threaten the human welfare. As the regulating power of national and international governments is limited, this challenge has generated a strong interest in the corporate social responsibility (CSR) of companies. Firms find it increasingly important to meet the expectations of stakeholders with respect to the company’s contribution to profit, planet, and people. The primary aim of this book is to introduce the reader to the impacts and drivers of CSR, with a special focus on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Research into the social and environmental impacts of CSR is rare. This is a serious gap because if CSR were to fail to have favourable social and environmental impacts on society, the whole concept may become redundant. If societal impacts of CSR are substantial, it is important to know the drivers of CSR. This book considers (1) factors internal to the company, (2) the competitive environment of the company, (3) institutions external to the company, and (4) how the impacts of institutions are mediated or moderated by company internal factors. This book will fill this gap by estimating various types of models that integrate external and internal factors driving CSR and its impacts on environment, innovation, and reputation, making it a valuable resource for researchers, academics, and students in the fields of business management and CSR.

      "descricao": "Corporate reputation is important in gaining long-term competitive advantage and building company value. Thus, the author points out the need to manage reputation, which, due to its complex nature and multidimensional character, is a serious and difficult challenge. The author develops a strategic model for family business reputation management. The book presents the review, systematization and synthesis of views on the notion of reputation and its role in building company value, the determinants of reputation; the identification of the characteristics and distinguishing factors of family businesses, areas of reputation building and resources involved in family business reputation building processes; and the description of determinants, components and processes in the field of corporate reputation management, and the identification of key links between them. It also identifies the key elements of the concept of family business reputation management and the relationship between them and practical recommendations for the use of reputation management concepts in improving the functioning of family businesses. The developed model can undoubtedly be seen as a pioneering contribution to research into the competitiveness of enterprises. The book will therefore be useful to researchers, students and managers who are interested in decision-making in family businesses, entrepreneurship and small business management, and leadership studies.",

      "descricao": "In the contemporary business landscape, the imperative for innovative approaches to business model innovation (BMI) is more pronounced than ever, especially given the pressing grand challenges, technological disruptions, digital transformation, and pressing environmental and social concerns of our era. The prevailing discourse in business model and BMI scholarship predominantly revolves around established frameworks and methodologies, thereby not fully capturing the burgeoning opportunities and transformative forces redefining BMI's future trajectory. This open access volume aims to fill the gap in scholarly discourse by offering a theory-rich exploration into the innovative pathways of business model innovation. Crafted for a global readership, this text serves as an invaluable resource for academic institutions, their faculty, students, and practitioners of business development within both expansive corporations and medium-sized enterprises. A key contribution of this edited book is the introduction of groundbreaking models and theoretical insights within the BMI domain, identifying key research gaps and further research venues for junior and senior academics to pursue, while enhancing the comprehension of how entities—ranging from individual organizations to expansive networks—can innovate, execute, and capitalize on BMI in the forthcoming landscape. Furthermore, this book elucidates the multifaceted nature of business model innovation across diverse contexts, illustrating the myriad ways BMI can be conceptualized and operationalized to achieve varying objectives, benefits, and results contingent upon the specific scenario. Lastly, this volume is dedicated to invigorating and equipping both nascent startups and entrenched firms to seize emergent BMI opportunities, fostering an environment where leveraging networks and platforms becomes a cornerstone for future business model innovation.",
